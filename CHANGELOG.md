# Changelog

This file records user-visible `rarpar` CLI changes. Library API changes are
documented in each crate's own changelog so those notes ship with the crate.

## rarpar 0.3.0

### CLI Changes

- Added global `--par-placement smart|canonical`. `smart` remains the default
  and locates renamed or moved protected files by content. `canonical` limits
  PAR2 work to recorded paths and explicitly supplied search locations.
- Added the direct repair-compatible form
  `rarpar r [-B DIR] PARFILE [WILDCARD]`. The documented `rarpar par verify`
  and `rarpar par repair` commands remain the general interface.
- Explicit RAR discovery now probes only the selected archive's
  name-compatible siblings and recognizes extended old-style `.rNN`, `.sNN`
  through `.zNN`, numeric, and post-numeric volume names.
- In `auto`, volumes restored from `.rev` files remain beside their archive
  set. `--output` affects extracted payloads, not restored intermediate
  volumes.
- Relative archive paths are canonicalized before compatibility-mode set
  discovery, avoiding accidental sibling selection when the working directory
  changes.
- Header-encrypted multi-volume archives use their validated filename family
  to assemble sibling volumes when encrypted headers hide volume topology.
- Normal compatibility `x` and `e` extraction restores missing volumes from
  discovered `.rev` recovery files before extraction. Incremental `-vp` mode
  remains non-mutating and waits for later volumes through its continue/quit
  protocol.
