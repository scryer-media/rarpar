# Changelog

## 0.3.0

This is a minor release from 0.2.3.

### Public API

- Added `xor_jit::packed`, including bounded packed batches, reusable
  workspaces, immutable AVX2 codebooks, explicit execution scratch, and code
  memory accounting.
- Added packed and prefetch-aware builders and runners on `JitWidth` and
  `PackedJitCode`.
- Added `strict_wx_available()` so callers can test whether executable memory
  can complete a writable-to-executable-to-writable round trip.

Existing scalar, matrix, RAR recovery, and `gf_simd` entry points remain
available. Callers using the new packed unsafe APIs must uphold the pointer,
length, alignment, and lifetime contracts documented on `PackedRun` and its
runner methods.

### Runtime Behavior

- XOR-JIT code follows strict W^X: mappings are writable while generated and
  executable only after sealing. Active mappings are returned to writable
  state only after all workers release them.
- Packed AVX2 generation uses bounded fixed slots and runtime CPU dispatch;
  release binaries are not specialized with `target-cpu`.
- The declared minimum supported Rust version is 1.97.1.
